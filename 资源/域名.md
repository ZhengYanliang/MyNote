KNOWLEDGE BASE INFORMATION REGARDING ERROR CODE 0x08823

=============================================================

Information to registrants that are getting error code 0x08823 
with new domain name registrations:

Your account is put on a watchlist with Freenom for one or more
of the following reasons:

1. You have registered too many domain names without actively 
using them and/or

2. You have registered too many domain names forwarding to the
same URL and/or

3. You have registered too many domain names using the same
name servers and/or

4. There is an increase of fraudulent used domains in your account
and/or

5. You are using more than one account with Freenom and/or

6. There are other reasons why the risk management department
of Freenom has determined the account should be put on the watchlist.

With the current status of your account:
- you are NOT allowed to register any new domain names
- you ARE able to renew existing domains without any problem
- you ARE able to modify or cancel any domain names

The management of Freenom cannot disclose the exact reasons why 
your account has been listed on Freenom's watchlist.

Removal of the watchlist is automated and is determined by Freenom's
systems and risk management department. Freenom is unable to
answer any queries on decisions made by the systems and/or
its risk management department.

Removal of the watchlist can happen earlier whenever we see
legimitate usage of the account - ensuring Freenom and its 
risk management department that you are not misusing the
systems for fraudulent reasons, i.e. domain hijacking.

(legimitate usage includes the registration of less domains,
payment for domains, active renewal of domains etc).
